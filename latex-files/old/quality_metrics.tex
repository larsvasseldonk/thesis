        \toprule
        Metric & Description\\
        \midrule
        CoHesion at Message level (CHM) & This metric measures the cohesiveness of interfaces of a given service at message level. This means it looks to the input and output parameters of the code entities within a service. \\
        \midrule
        CoHesion at Domain level (CHD) & CHD measures the cohesiveness of interfaces of a given service at domain level. The metric quantifies how cohesive interfaces inside a service are based on the similarity of domain (textual) terms embedded in the name of the operations.\\
        \midrule
        Structural Modularity Quality (SMQ) & The SMQ is a variation of the Modularity Quality (MQ) proposed by \citeauthor{mancoridis1998using} \cite{mancoridis1998using} in which the modularity depends on the structural (call) dependencies.\\
        \midrule
        Conceptual Modularity Quality (CMQ) & In the CMQ the modularity of the candidate microservices is calculated upon semantic dependencies instead of structural dependencies. A semantic dependency is defined when two code entities share a similar term.\\
